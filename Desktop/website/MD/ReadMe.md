#Heading One 
This is the heading one paragraph.

Markdown it is the simple/lightweight markup language which is plain text formatting used by the developers(mostly).

Markdown it is the file in the repository its is the first file seen to your project. Also it is end with the .md extension 

*This is an italic style*

The two ways to make your text an italic is by wrapping your text with one star/underscore

consider the example below 
*This is an italic text style by using the star wrapping*

_This is an italic text style by using an underscore_

bolding text in the markdown 
If you want to bold your text in the markdwon you should wrap your text with double stars/double underscore.

**This is the bolded text in the md**
__also you can use double underscore to bold your text in the md.__

Such that if you want both bold and italic simultenousy use three stars(asterisks)/underscores.
***This is bolded and italized at the same time by using three asterisks(stars)/underscore***
___by using underscore___

Strikethrough
use tildes on both side to stringthrough your words or phrases
~~This is strikingThrough the words or phrases by using tildes on both side~~

Links 
To links to the external website uses two set of the brackets which are squire bracket [link text] and the parenthesis to put URL.
Example below 
[Google](www.google.com);

[Markdown Study](index.html);

Image in the markdwon 
begins with the exclamation followed by the squire bracket with the alt text such as:
![This is map js snapcode](map.filter1.png);

[Email](mussajust5@gmail.com);

For image
This is an object snapcode
![Objec](object2.png)

Make sure that in inserting image in the markdown there is no space between exclamation, squire bracket and parenthesis.

Lists in the markdown 
 There are two types of lists which are ordered and unordered lists.

 -Markdown should answer the question of why, how and what since it is the first thing to be seen on your repository.
 -The problems solved by using project.
 -Language/frameworks/library used to build your project.
 -Also helps to the users to know your documentations skills.
 -Lisence.

1.My name is Mussa.
2.I come from Tanzania.
3.Frontend and Weekend developer.
